A simple and responsive web app that:
* Generates a printable list of multiplication and/or division exercises
* Generates a time trial of multiplication and/or division exercises

You can:
* Choose between multiplications, divisions or both
* Select what tables you want to exercise (1 to 10)
* How many exercises you want to print
* Define how many columns of exercises you want to print
* Choose to show/hide the solutions
* How fast the time trial goes
* If it shows the solution after each exercies
* Pause, continue, stop and repeat the time trial

TODO:
* Allow the web app to be used to let children fill in the answer (both in the sheet or during the time trial)
